2022 felt like a pretty rough year for all of us. A lot of things were happening in macroeconomic environment, to put lightly. Beyond the economic environment, there was also seemingly a non-stop deluge of rough news of our state of the world - wars, climate change, civil unrest, continuing effects of the pandemic, and so on. Tech world alone is going through challenging times.

Over the holidays I was reflecting on how all of such things are affecting the people on my team last year. The stress of all of this put together can manifest differently from person to person, either directly or something more latent and all colors in between. One thing became clear -- _as a manager, this is a critical time to become source of support and leadership to the team to ensure the team feels like there is a clear backbone and guidance in these chaotic times_.

With that in mind as an engineering manager I have one goal this year - _simplicity_.

- To make processes simpler for the people on my team. 
- To help make the world make more sense. 
- To make projects simpler, so they're easier to understand and their trajectory crystal clear. 
- To remove walls and blockers as fast as I can because we really don't need more frustrations in our lives.
- To remove busy work, and pointless ventures. 
- To aggressively refine and reduce tasks to do less and do them better. 
- To be even better at being in tune with people on my team to catch red flags faster.
- Try to do the above for adjacent teams as well. 

I'll see how well I pursue this goal this year and evaluate at the end of the year. Simplicity should be a goal for leaders all the time, but it really does seem like the highest priority right now.
