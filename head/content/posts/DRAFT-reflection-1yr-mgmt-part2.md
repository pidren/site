### _LISTEN and convince_
This is something I'm always practicing to get better at. My own manager is incredibly good at listening and I learn from him constantly - to just shut up and listen. It is single most valuable skill not just as a manager, but life in general. There's no greater power and most useful skill as being able to listen, quietly, without interrupting anyone else - why? 

-- because by talking you are _not convincing anyone_. You convince by listening to what others are saying then _guiding_ them from _their_ viewpoint to _your_ viewpoint. Of course this is a generalized statement, but I can't tell you how many times this has been true.
